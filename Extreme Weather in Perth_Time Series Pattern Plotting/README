Dataset Summary 

An NOAA dataset has been stored in the directory https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-historical-climatology-network-daily/access/. This is the dataset used in here. The data for use is a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.
Note: Specifically, we use the observation data from stations in the city of Perth, Australia with hash_id='037e6a0b7236fd24ae99b4f271f3602408953c052bacce7622883c01'.



Dictionary:

STATION: station identification code (17 characters). Please see http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt
for a complete list of stations and their metadata.
NAME: the name of the station (usually city/airport name) (max 50 characters).
DATE : the year of the record (4 digits) followed by month (2 digits) and day (2 digits).
TMAX : Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C).
TMIN : Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C).
LONGITUDE: Longitude of the station.
LATITUDE: Latitude of the station.



About Time:

Baseline: every day in the year 2000 to 2022
Target: every day in the year 2023



Steps:

1. Get target station list, retrive longitudes and latitudes, then pin them on map.
2. Extract data from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-historical-climatology-network-daily/access/ with specified Station ID.
3. Basic data checks and metic transformation.
4. Preparing data for plotting. Get maximun and minimun obervation in the period of baseline time. Grab the observations in 2023 for which broke the recods high or record low from 2000 to 2022.
5. Plotting. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day will be shaded. To overlay a scatter of the 2023 data for points (highs and lows) breaking the records.
